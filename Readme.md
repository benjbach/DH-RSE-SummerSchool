# Good Data Visualisation

The third day of the Summer School will focus on how to present your data efficiently. 
We focus on best practices and pathways to generate informative, reusable and open visualisations of your datasets.

The day will be kick off with a talk from **[Benjamin Bach](https://visualinteractivedata.github.io/bach)** from the [VisHub](https://visualinteractivedata.github.io) Edinburgh, titled “Data Visualization: From Exploration to Storytelling to Participation” that will focus on the importance of good data visualisation in research.

After this talk we are going to explore the [Vistorian](vistorian.github.io) tool with **Mashael AlKadi**. 
The Vistorian is an online tool for interactive exploration of dynamic, multivariate, and geographic networks.
It is an active research project at the Vishub at the University of Edinburgh and Inria, France. 
The first hour will be a demo session open to all attendees that will focus on exploring the Vistorian interface and features and how you can prepare your data to use the Vistorian.

After the lunch break we move to the more hands-on part of the day. The afternoon will be kicked off by a practical tutorial with [Vistorian](vistorian.net). 
Attendees will be able to either use the provided demo dataset or to explore thier own data (if you plan to be BYOD please check [this wiki](https://vistorian.github.io/formattingdata.html) on how to prepare your data to use them within the Vistorian platform. If you have experience any issues, please get in touch with the [Vistorian Team](mailto:vistorian@inria.fr). For more information on how to get ready for the practical see the `Readme.md` file within the `Vistorian` folder in this repo.

We are then going to move on to the second practical tutorial that will focus on how to produce good data visualisation with R.
This 2-hours tutorial will be lead by **Lucia Michielin** and will give you an introductory overview to the basic techniques for producing informative and reproducible visualisation of tabular data.  
Participants will learn how to enter and modify data in R, and how to create visualisations, including the main graph typologies available depending on the type of variables (charts, scatter plots, and histograms, etc.). #
Participants will also get an overview on how to customise your graph (from adding legends to controlling the colours palettes).  
For more information on how to get ready for the practical see the `Readme.md` file within the `R Studio` folder in this repo.

The day will be concluded by an RSE Story by **Lucy Havens**.

## Presenters and Organisers

This day is organised by CDCS ([Centre for Data, Culture & Society](https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/)). 
The Centre is a space for experimentation, innovation and skills development, and tailored support to researches based at the College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Science of the Edinburgh University. 
The Centre offer extensive training opportunities across a variety of applied digital research methods and work to showcase the potential of data-rich and applied digital research.

The speakers of the day are: 

- **Dr. Benjamin Bach**. Lecturer in Design Informatics and Visualization at the University of Edinburgh. 
His research designs and investigates interactive information visualization interfaces to help people explore, communicate, and understand data.
- **Mashael AlKadi**.  PhD student at School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. 
Interested in data sciences, data visualization, web tech and NLP. Currently working on enhancing data visualizations through learning analytics.
- **Dr. Lucia Michielin**. Training Manager for the CDCS. 
Her main responsibilities involves planning and co-ordinating of a comprehensive digital research methods training programme for academic researchers in the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Science. 
- **Lucy Havens**.  PhD student at School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh.
Lucy is researching bias in cultural heritage metadata. 
In her research she seeks to identify and classify bias present in the language of cultural heritage catalogues. She is also a Training Fellow for the CDCS.
